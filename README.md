# Kickstart My Chart

Data analysis and visualization of a database of Kickstarter projects to help uncover why Kickstarter projects are successful, fail, or are canceled.

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. In this data analysis, I have organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover some hidden trends.
